# Smart-Contract-Payroll-System-Project
Nowadays in the midst of pandemic, both the employees and employers
are struggling with wage payment plan and payroll systems. Particularly,
for those client-facing and project-based companies, the employees
have been finding it hard to be paid for services performed or minutes
of service, while the employers are considering to save cost with thirdparty
payroll agencies and result in delay of payment. In addition, both
the biometric data of employees and the companyâ€™s financial data can
be leaked in the middle of this. The problem we are trying to tackle here
is how can employees be paid more efficiently without any disputes, how
can employers pay them in a more cost-saving, timely, and secure
manner, meanwhile assuring that both sides feel their rights are
protected and are content throughout the process. Our project is not
only different from others, as it is leveraging the smart contract on salary
payment system, but also unique, since there has been no blockchain
project dealing with payroll issues.
